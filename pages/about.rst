About
=====

I have recently joined the trend of taking my blog 'static' rather than using a
more complicated database driven solution like `Wordpress <http://wordpress.com>`_.  One major reason for
me is that I like to write content in abstraction.  I love `LaTeX <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX>`_ for this reason
and I love Sphinx for the same reason.  I chose `Tinkerer <http://www.tinkerer.me/>`_ as my static engine
because it is actually built from `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ and it is written in my favorite
language (`Python <http://www.python.org/>`_).  Sphinx is a code documentation framework originally built
for python.  I use it to generate my documentation using reStructuredText
markup. I figured since I am more-or-less used to the way Sphinx does its
markup, I would choose a blog engine that worked the same way.  So far, I
like it.  It is a bit less mature than some of the other static engines out
there (`Octopress <http://octopress.org/>`_ being a VERY popular one) but I think it will grow nicely.


The name *"Moving The Lamppost"*
--------------------------------

*Moving The Lamppost* is a reference to `the streetlight
effect <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect>`_.  I first heard the
parable from a professor in my Probabilistic Modeling of Biological Data
course.  It goes something like this:

  A police officer encounters a drunk fumbling around under a streetlight late
  at night and asks him what he is doing.  The drunk responds that he is looking
  for his keys.  The officer asks where he lost them. The drunk says he
  lost them across the street in the Park. Exasperated, the officer asks him why
  on earth he is looking for them over here. "Because this is where the light
  is," responds the drunk.

In one sense this is something of a metaphor for some situations that we find ourselves in
as scientists.  We have a question we want to explore.  An important one.  But
there are times when the tools available to us, or some critical idea or model
related to our problem has yet to be created/formulated.  So we go to work with
the tools we have.  This can cause much wasted time and money, however.  So we
must always have a couple questions in the back of our mind as we pursue our
questions: 

1. "Am I looking where the answer is actually likely to be or simply where the light is?"
2. "If I am stuck under a lamppost, is there a way to extend the reach of the light so that it includes the answer?" (Can I move this lamppost)

From another angle *Moving The Lamppost* can represent the most basic goal of science: to extend the edges of what is known.

The purpose of this blog
-------------------------

My main goal for *Moving The Lamppost* is to serve as a place for me to record random thoughts about my work and what is going on in science at large in such a way that I can engage in dialog with others about it.
Relating to that goal is my desire to foster relationships with other scientists or informed hobbyists that can approach what is termed `Open Science <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science>`_.
I hope to make this my home base for sharing what I am interested in as well as what I am actually working on: including data and figures.

For a nice introduction to the ideals of Open Science take a look at `the excellent blog series <http://scienceinthesands.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/7-habits-of-open-scientist.html>`_ by `David Ketcheson <http://www.davidketcheson.info/>`_ over at `Science in the Sands <http://scienceinthesands.blogspot.co.uk/>`_

About me:
=========

Augustine Dunn
--------------
**PhD Candidate: Bioinformatics, Molecular Biology, Transcriptomics**


I use bioinformatics to study gene regulation and expression at the transcriptome level. I currently work in mosquitoes. Specifically, I use RNA-seq and microarray technology to study how bloodfeeding affects gene expression in mosquitoes, and look for over represented patterns in regulatory DNA.

I use python, R, shell scripting and manage a local `Galaxy <https://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/>`_ instance to manage the lab's bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing analysis needs.

The long term goal of my current lab is to produce genetically modified mosquitoes that do not transmit Malaria or Dengue Fever that will spread this trait swiftly through local mosquito populations.
