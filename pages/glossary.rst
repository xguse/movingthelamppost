	reporter gene
		`In molecular biology, a reporter gene (often simply reporter) is a gene that researchers attach to a regulatory sequence of another gene of interest in bacteria, cell culture, animals or plants. Certain genes are chosen as reporters because the characteristics they confer on organisms expressing them are easily identified and measured (cause the cells to glow), or because they are selectable markers (allow only the cells with the reporter to survive in the presence of a poison). <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporter_gene>`_
	
	promoter
		`In genetics, a promoter is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular gene. Promoters are located near the genes they transcribe, on the same strand and upstream on the DNA. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(genetics)>`_
	
	transcription factor
		`In molecular biology and genetics, a transcription factor (sometimes called a sequence-specific DNA-binding factor) is a protein that binds to specific DNA sequences, thereby controlling the flow (or transcription) of genetic information from DNA to mRNA. Transcription factors perform this function alone or with other proteins in a complex, by promoting (as an activator), or blocking (as a repressor) the recruitment of RNA polymerase (the enzyme that performs the transcription of genetic information from DNA to RNA) to specific genes. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor>`_
		
	genotype
		the specific genetic sequence of an individual organism. example: the mutation in an eye color gene that results in blue eyes.
		
	phenotype
		any observable genetic trait of an individual organism. examples: eye color, height, malformed wings, feathers, scales, venom, etc
	
	gene drive
		molecular genetic tactics that cause a linked trait or gene to spread through a population at faster rates than expected based on fitness alone; generally operating independently of natural selection and genetic drift.
	
	transposon
	transposable element
		relatively short regions of DNA in an organism's genome that have the ability to cut (or copy) themselves from the genome and insert themselves into a new location in the genome.  (`More information on different types and behaviors of TEs <http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/transposons-the-jumping-genes-518>`_)
	
	RNA-seq
		`RNA-seq, also called "Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing" ("WTSS"), refers to the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies to sequence cDNA in order to get information about a sample's RNA content. The technique has been adopted in studies of diseases like cancer. With deep coverage and base-level resolution, next-generation sequencing provides information on differential expression of genes, including gene alleles and differently spliced transcripts; non-coding RNAs; post-transcriptional mutations or editing; and gene fusions. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq>`_
		
	effector gene
		in *this* sense: a gene that will cause the desired change in the environment of the mosquito or other vector.  An example might be a gene that codes for a protein that targets and destroys the pathogen.

	prevalence
		`the number or proportion of cases or events or attributes among a given population. <http://www.cdc.gov/excite/library/glossary.htm#prevalence>`_

	incidence
		`a measure of the frequency with which new cases of illness, injury, or other health condition occurs among a population during a specified period. <http://www.cdc.gov/excite/library/glossary.htm#incidence>`_

	midgut
		the location in the mosquito's digestive system where the bloodmeal is processed.

	hemolymph
		the insect analog of a circulatory system.

	vector
		an organism that facilitates the transfer of pathogens from one host to another.

	transmission cycle
		the cycle by which a pathogen is transmitted from one host to another.

	dissertation
		a document submitted in support of candidature for an academic doctorate qualification presenting the candidate's research and findings. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis

	transgenesis
		a process by which exogenous DNA sequences (sometimes termed transgenes) are introduced to a host organism (usually with the goal of performing a novel function in the host). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis

	exogenous
		not originating from the system to which the object is being applied. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exogenous

	transgene
		a (usually functional) gene that has been transferred from one organism to another. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgene

	genome
		the sum of an organism's genetic material (RNA or DNA). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome

	dengue fever
		a tropical disease caused by one of four species of dengue viruses characterized by fever, headache, muscle and joint pains, and a skin rash similar to measles. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever

	malaria
		a tropical disease caused by one of multiple species of protist in the genus *Plasmodium* characterized by recurring cycles of fever and headache. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria
