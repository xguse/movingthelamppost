Elements of transgenic disease-vector control (Part 1: setting the scene)
=========================================================================

Mosquito borne disease
-----------------------
- many but we focus on Dengue Fever and Malaria
- causative agents
- people dont give people these two diseases
- mosquitoes generally dont give mosquitoes these diseases

Transmission cycle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. female mosquito bites infected person
2. pathogen is taken into mosquito gut with bloodmeal
3. pathogen must escape the gut and gain access to the mosquito's circulatory system (now the animal is **infected**)
4. pathogen must gain access to the mosquito's salivary glands (now the animal is **infectious**)
5. female bites uninfected human and pathogens in saliva are introduced to the person's body

Public health: *multiple targets*
---------------------------------
- what are the goals of public health interventions with these diseases?
- What can be done to achieve these?
	- focus on the human
	- focus on the vector

Options for the humans
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- treat the sick
- prevent people from getting sick or at least from infecting a vector

Conventional options for the vectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Reduce the number of vectors near the population (**Vector Population Reduction**)
	- removal of breeding sites
	- insecticide treatments
	- sterile insect technique
- Reduce the number of times people get bitten by vectors
	- bed nets
	- better separation of outside and inside (Air Conditioning and good windows)

Transgenic options for the vectors
----------------------------------
- Vector population reduction
- Vector population conversion
