Elements of transgenic disease-vector control (Part 2: altering the mosquitoes)
===============================================================================

.. _four-fundamentals-of-transgenic-vector-control:

The four fundamentals of transgenic vector control
--------------------------------------------------
1. the ability to introduce :term:`transgenes <transgene>` into the mosquito's genome in a heritable way
2. discovery or construction effector genes
3. the ability to control when and where the :term:`effector genes <effector gene>` are activated 
4. the ability of your transgenic mosquitoes to have **swift**, dramatic, and clinically meaningful effects on the native vector population

	**transgene**
		a sequence of DNA that contains instructions for the controlled expression of a gene product (protein or functional RNA) that is meant to be inserted into an organism's genome for the purpose of allowing the gene product to be produced by the target organism.

	**vector**
