<h1>Exploring Various ways to combine transcription profile correlation (<em>r</em>), confidence in that correlation (<em>p value</em> associated with <em>r</em>), and phylogenetic distance (<em>w(d)</em>) between species into a useful PTC index (Phylogenetic Transcription Conservation Index)</h1>
<div class="section" id="original-solution">
<h2>Original solution</h2>
<p><span class="formula"><i>PTCI</i> = <i>r</i>⋅(1 − <i>p</i>)⋅<i>w</i>(<i>d</i>)</span>
</p>
<p>Xiaohui objected that <em>1-p</em> is not optimal because the <em>1-p</em> will likely
have a distribution skewed toward <em>1</em>. He suggested loging the variable,
among other options (see below).</p>

<h3>Original Results</h3>

<p>This is a histogram of the three way mean PTCIs using the original
solution. Blue=Real data. Grey=Randomizations that abolish the three way
orthology relationships. The ‘Null’ distribution [grey] is significantly
different from the real data [blue] but has significant structure that
is not what one would predict (resemble a normal dist). Notably, there is
a large concentration around -0.5 that I can not explain.</p>

<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>I have recently joined the trend of taking my blog ‘static’ rather than using a
more complicated database driven solution like <a class="reference external" href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>.  One major reason for
me is that I like to write content in abstraction.  I love <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> for this reason
and I love Sphinx for the same reason.  I chose <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tinkerer.me">Tinkerer</a> as my static engine
because it is actually built from <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-doc.org">Sphinx</a> and it is written in my favorite
language (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>).  Sphinx is a code documentation framework originally built
for python.  I use it to generate my documentation using reStructuredText
markup. I figured since I am more-or-less used to the way Sphinx does its
markup, I would choose a blog engine that worked the same way.  So far, I
like it.  It is a bit less mature than some of the other static engines out
there (<a class="reference external" href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> being a VERY popular one) but I think it will grow nicely.</p>

<h2>The name <em>“Moving The Lamppost”</em></h2>
<p><em>Moving The Lamppost</em> is a reference to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect">the streetlight
effect</a>.  I first heard the
parable from a professor in my Probabilistic Modeling of Biological Data
course.  It goes something like this:</p>
