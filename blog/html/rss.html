<h1>Exploring Various ways to combine transcription profile correlation (<em>r</em>), confidence in that correlation (<em>p value</em> associated with <em>r</em>), and phylogenetic distance (<em>w(d)</em>) between species into a useful PTC index (Phylogenetic Transcription Conservation Index)</h1>
<div class="section" id="original-solution">
<h2>Original solution</h2>
<p><span class="formula"><i>PTCI</i> = <i>r</i>⋅(1 − <i>p</i>)⋅<i>w</i>(<i>d</i>)</span>
</p>
<p>Xiaohui objected that <em>1-p</em> is not optimal because the <em>1-p</em> will likely
have a distribution skewed toward <em>1</em>. He suggested loging the variable,
among other options (see below).</p>
<div class="section" id="original-results">
<h3>Original Results</h3>

<p>This is a histogram of the three way mean PTCIs using the original
solution. Blue=Real data. Grey=Randomizations that abolish the three way
orthology relationships. The ‘Null’ distribution [grey] is significantly
different from the real data [blue] but has significant structure that
is not what one would predict (resemble a normal dist). Notably, there is
a large concentration around -0.5 that I can not explain.</p>

<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>I have recently joined the trend of taking my blog ‘static’ rather than using a
more complicated database driven solution like <a class="reference external" href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>.  One major reason for
me is that I like to write content in abstraction.  I love <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> for this reason
and I love Sphinx for the same reason.  I chose <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tinkerer.me">Tinkerer</a> as my static engine
because it is actually built from <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-doc.org">Sphinx</a> and it is written in my favorite
language (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>).  Sphinx is a code documentation framework originally built
for python.  I use it to generate my documentation using reStructuredText
markup. I figured since I am more-or-less used to the way Sphinx does its
markup, I would choose a blog engine that worked the same way.  So far, I
like it.  It is a bit less mature than some of the other static engines out
there (<a class="reference external" href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> being a VERY popular one) but I think it will grow nicely.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-name-moving-the-lamppost">
<h2>The name <em>“Moving The Lamppost”</em></h2>
<p><em>Moving The Lamppost</em> is a reference to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect">the streetlight
effect</a>.  I first heard the
parable from a professor in my Probabilistic Modeling of Biological Data
course.  It goes something like this:
.. more:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>A police officer encounters a drunk fumbling around under a streetlight late
at night and asks him what he is doing.  The drunk responds that he is looking
for his keys.  The officer asks where he lost them. The drunk says he
lost them across the street in the Park. Exasperated, the officer asks him why
on earth he is looking for them over here. &quot;Because this is where the light
is,&quot; responds the drunk.</pre>
</div>
<p>In one sense this is something of a metaphor for some situations that we find ourselves in
as scientists.  We have a question we want to explore.  An important one.  But
there are times when the tools available to us, or some critical idea or model
related to our problem has yet to be created/formulated.  So we go to work with
the tools we have.  This can cause much wasted time and money, however.  So we
must always have a couple questions in the back of our mind as we pursue our
questions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>“Am I looking where the answer is actually likely to be or simply where the light is?”</li>
<li>“If I am stuck under a lamppost, is there a way to extend the reach of the light so that it includes the answer?” (Can I move this lamppost)</li>
</ol>
<p>From another angle <em>Moving The Lamppost</em> can represent the most basic goal of science: to extend the edges of what is known.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-purpose-of-this-blog">
<h2>The purpose of this blog</h2>
<p>My main goal for <em>Moving The Lamppost</em> is to serve as a place for me to record random thoughts about my work and what is going on in science at large in such a way that I can engage in dialog with others about it.
Relating to that goal is my desire to foster relationships with other scientists or informed hobbyists that can approach what is termed <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">Open Science</a>.
I hope to make this my home base for sharing what I am interested in as well as what I am actually working on: including data and figures.</p>
<p>For a nice introduction to the ideals of Open Science take a look at <a class="reference external" href="http://scienceinthesands.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/7-habits-of-open-scientist.html">the excellent blog series</a> by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.davidketcheson.info">David Ketcheson</a> over at <a class="reference external" href="http://scienceinthesands.blogspot.co.uk">Science in the Sands</a></p>
