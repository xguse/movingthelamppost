<h2>Elevator Speech</h2>
<div class="section" id="academic-significance">
<h3>Academic Significance</h3>
<p>Other studies have demonstrated individual instances of conservation of sequence elements that are no longer <strong>globally alignable</strong> due to extended phylogenetic divergence.  Familiar examples include the demonstration that some transgenic enhancer regions from orthologous genes in distantly related species are able to drive correct gene expression of the host species even though <strong>global alignment</strong> of the enhancer regions was impossible.</p>
<p>However the authors claim that this is the first genome-scale study they know of that supports the phenomena of selective constraint acting on sequence elements absent of identifiable sequence conservation.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">By terms like ‘identifiable sequence conservation’, they really seem to be referring to the ability to generate meaningful <strong>global alignment</strong> since they plainly use <strong>local alignment</strong> to identity the sequences they propose are being selectively retained.</p>

<h3>Main Hypotheses</h3>
<p><span class="formula"><i>H</i><sub>1</sub></span>
: the presence of a ‘conserved’ segment between two less divergent species should <em>overall</em> predict the presence of corresponding conserved segments in a separate pair of similarly divergent species that together have a much larger pair-to-pair divergence distance (see <a class="reference internal" href="http://movingthelamppost.com/blog/html/2013/04/16/vakhrusheva_et_al_gbe_2013.html#f1"><em>Figure 1</em></a> for graphical representation). <strong>[relevant figures:</strong> <a class="reference internal" href="http://movingthelamppost.com/blog/html/2013/04/16/vakhrusheva_et_al_gbe_2013.html#f2"><em>Figure 2</em></a> <strong>]</strong></p>
<p><span class="formula"><i>H</i><sub>2</sub></span>
: if <em>empirically validated</em> regulatory elements persist longer than the sequence similarity of the corresponding DNA segments, introns containing a regulatory element in pair 1 should carry a corresponding segment in pair 2 at rates higher than expected by chance. <strong>[relevant figures:</strong> <a class="reference internal" href="http://movingthelamppost.com/blog/html/2013/04/16/vakhrusheva_et_al_gbe_2013.html#f3"><em>Figure 3</em></a> <strong>]</strong></p>
<p><span class="formula"><i>H</i><sub>3</sub></span>
: presence of a functional element in an orthologous intron in one species pair should correlate with a reduced instance of intron loss when compared to an outgroup serving as a way to infer the presence/absence of the functional element in a distant common ancestor. <strong>[relevant figures:</strong> <a class="reference internal" href="http://movingthelamppost.com/blog/html/2013/04/16/vakhrusheva_et_al_gbe_2013.html#f4"><em>Figure 4</em></a> <strong>]</strong></p>
<p><span class="formula"><i>H</i><sub>4</sub></span>
: because others have already established that longer introns are more likely to carry a segment of conservation than short introns, a function conserved in all four species should be expected to be associated with larger intron length  when conserved in pair 1 <em>and</em> pair 2, compared with the introns lost in pair 2. <strong>[relevant figures:</strong> <a class="reference internal" href="http://movingthelamppost.com/blog/html/2013/04/16/vakhrusheva_et_al_gbe_2013.html#f5"><em>Figure 5</em></a> <strong>]</strong></p>

<h1>Blogging my dissertation</h1>
<p>I am not surprised or disappointed that <a class="reference external" href="http://chronicle.com/article/How-Blogging-Helped-Me-Write/136893">this idea has already been done</a>.
In fact, I am quite encouraged that I read that others that have done this so far have had such great experiences with it.
I began to think about using my blog to help me get over my reluctance to simply sit down and write for quite a few years.
However, I somehow never made the connection that I could also use it to help me actually write the documents themselves.
It was only recently, after <a class="reference external" href="http://movingthelamppost.com/blog/html/2013/04/04/hello__world_.html">making a personal promise</a> to engage more frequently and vigorously in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">open science</a> endeavor, that I started to research how the idea had worked out for other people.</p>

<h1>Exploring Various ways to combine transcription profile correlation (<em>r</em>), confidence in that correlation (<em>p value</em> associated with <em>r</em>), and phylogenetic distance (<em>w(d)</em>) between species into a useful PTC index (Phylogenetic Transcription Conservation Index)</h1>
<div class="section" id="original-solution">
<h2>Original solution</h2>
<p><span class="formula"><i>PTCI</i> = <i>r</i>⋅(1 − <i>p</i>)⋅<i>w</i>(<i>d</i>)</span>
</p>
<p>Xiaohui objected that <em>1-p</em> is not optimal because the <em>1-p</em> will likely
have a distribution skewed toward <em>1</em>. He suggested loging the variable,
among other options (see below).</p>
<div class="section" id="original-results">
<h3>Original Results</h3>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="http://movingthelamppost.com/blog/html/_images/Ag_Aa_Cq_3way_PTCI.png"><img alt="../../../_images/Ag_Aa_Cq_3way_PTCI.png" src="http://movingthelamppost.com/blog/html/_images/Ag_Aa_Cq_3way_PTCI.png" style="width: 600px;"/></a>
<p>This is a histogram of the three way mean PTCIs using the original
solution. Blue=Real data. Grey=Randomizations that abolish the three way
orthology relationships. The ‘Null’ distribution [grey] is significantly
different from the real data [blue] but has significant structure that
is not what one would predict (resemble a normal dist). Notably, there is
a large concentration around -0.5 that I can not explain.</p>

<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>I have recently joined the trend of taking my blog ‘static’ rather than using a
more complicated database driven solution like <a class="reference external" href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>.  One major reason for
me is that I like to write content in abstraction.  I love <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> for this reason
and I love Sphinx for the same reason.  I chose <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tinkerer.me">Tinkerer</a> as my static engine
because it is actually built from <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-doc.org">Sphinx</a> and it is written in my favorite
language (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>).  Sphinx is a code documentation framework originally built
for python.  I use it to generate my documentation using reStructuredText
markup. I figured since I am more-or-less used to the way Sphinx does its
markup, I would choose a blog engine that worked the same way.  So far, I
like it.  It is a bit less mature than some of the other static engines out
there (<a class="reference external" href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> being a VERY popular one) but I think it will grow nicely.</p>
