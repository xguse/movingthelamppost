	RNA-seq
		`RNA-seq, also called "Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing" ("WTSS"), refers to the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies to sequence cDNA in order to get information about a sample's RNA content. The technique has been adopted in studies of diseases like cancer. With deep coverage and base-level resolution, next-generation sequencing provides information on differential expression of genes, including gene alleles and differently spliced transcripts; non-coding RNAs; post-transcriptional mutations or editing; and gene fusions. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq>`_
		
	effector gene
		in *this* sense: a gene that will cause the desired change in the environment of the mosquito or other vector.  An example might be a gene that codes for a protein that targets and destroys the pathogen.

	prevalence
		`the number or proportion of cases or events or attributes among a given population. <http://www.cdc.gov/excite/library/glossary.htm#prevalence>`_

	incidence
		`a measure of the frequency with which new cases of illness, injury, or other health condition occurs among a population during a specified period. <http://www.cdc.gov/excite/library/glossary.htm#incidence>`_

	midgut
		the location in the mosquito's digestive system where the bloodmeal is processed.

	hemolymph
		the insect analog of a circulatory system.

	vector
		an organism that facilitates the transfer of pathogens from one host to another.

	transmission cycle
		the cycle by which a pathogen is transmitted from one host to another.

	dissertation
		a document submitted in support of candidature for an academic doctorate qualification presenting the candidate's research and findings. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis

	transgenesis
		a process by which exogenous DNA sequences (sometimes termed transgenes) are introduced to a host organism (usually with the goal of performing a novel function in the host). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenesis

	exogenous
		not originating from the system to which the object is being applied. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exogenous

	transgene
		a (usually functional) gene that has been transfered from one organism to another. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgene

	genome
		the sum of an organism's genetic material (RNA or DNA). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome

	dengue fever
		a tropical disease caused by one of four species of dengue viruses characterized by fever, headache, muscle and joint pains, and a skin rash similar to measles. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever

	malaria
		a tropical disease caused by one of multiple species of protist in the genus *Plasmodium* characterized by recurring cycles of fever and headache. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria
