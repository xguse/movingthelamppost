Arthropod Genomics Symposium 2013 -- Notre Dame
===============================================

My notes on talks from the `7th Annual Arthropod Genomics Symposium <http://globalhealth.nd.edu/7th-annual-arthropod-genomics-symposium/>`_  If you are interested, you can follow live tweets from `#13ArthGen <https://twitter.com/search?q=%2313arthgen&src=typd>`_.

.. note:: Obviously, my spelling is gonna suck on this.  Please don't hold it against me!?




General Session
-------------------
Dan Lawson
**************

- Federated curation and hosting of genomes plus standardized best practices and data formats needed for #i5k

Steven Richards (Fringy)
**************************

- ND50 10kb basic bar to reach for good annotation through Maker

Terence Murphy
********************
How to annotate 5000 genomes: lessons from NCBI genome annotation pipeline

Monica Munoz-Torez
*********************
Web Apollo web based annotation editing platform

- first realtime genome collaborative annotation editor on the web
- MANUAL annotation is NECESSARY not just desirable: without it many downstream experiments will be poisoned
- democratization of genome assembly and annotation require a new model of collaborative annotation

Genome of primitively social wasp "Polistes dominula": insights/opportunity for understanding genomic basis of eusociality

- low repetitive elements	
- even lower TE content
- genomic suspects for social evolution
    - genetic toolkits -- conserved gene sets
        - evo-devo approach --comparative
        - conservation of Hox genes etc
            - cis regulatory changes very important as changes in expression vs gene function important in evolution/speciation
        - transcriptomic look at
            - foraging
                - foraging transcriptome profiles agree with apis mellifera
            - dominance
                - compared transcriptomes of brains in dominant vs submissive individuals
                - found correlations of aggressive behavior in fruit flies and even mammals
    - epigenetics
        - controls wild diff in phenotypic models -- same genome gives VERY diff morphologies
        - cast related diff in DNA methylation are present
        - treatment with methyl inhibitor causes more worker like phenotypes
        - however dna meth not likely to be related to cast diff through diff expression, but maybe through splicing control
        - Dnmt3 (usually needed for DNA meth) not found yet in this genome
    - novel genes

Sequencing the Antarctic Midge, Belgica antarctica: the smallest insect genome

- poly extremophile
    - cold -- frozen solid 8-9 months a year
    - 70% loss of body water
    - salinity
    - pH
    - UV EXPOSURE
- Heat shock proteins on almost constitutively
- Dessication 30% helps them survive low temps
- initial genome size of ~ 85 Mb?! -- then confirmed
- 13,500 protein encoding genes anyway
- uniqueness of the genome:
    - small size -- probly due to extremophile life
    - consistently small introns
    - few repetitive elements
    - few TEs -- usually old and probably inactive
    - 47% GC
    - function enrich:
        - up
            - membrane
            - ATP binding
        - dwn
            - oderant binding
            - oderant receptors
            - sensory perception of smell in general
- pathway of dessication protection
    - up regulation of autophagy
    - inhibit apoptosis
    - metabolism genes shutdown
- lead to focus on aquaporins as related to dehydration responses in diff tissues
- How does clock work in these extreme light/dark cycles
    - clock genes not correlated with light cycle at all
    - locomotor activity shows no diurnal bias
- genes still there and still expressed but the cyclic nature of transcription is NOT observed

Epigenetics

*****************************************
Linking DNA methylation to phenotype in the pea aphid

- meth found in gene bodies primarily in exons
- Methylation associated with higher expression (only at global level?)
- differences bt morphs:
	- methyl patterns plainly morph specific by PCA 2D
	- intron specific CHH methylation flat in wingless/asex but very pronounced in Sexual morphs
- function of intergenic DNA methylation:
	- skipped exons should have higher methylations bc CTCF cant bind the exon to slow down the machinerey to allow that exon to be recognized as NOT intron
	- this IS detected by the speaker
	- role for DNA methylation in dcerning paralogs?
		- example used is RNAi genes (Dicer etc)

Micheal Goodisman (GA Tech)
*******************************
Function of DNA methylation in insects

- DNA methylation lost in some insects
	- NO METHEYL IN DIPTERA?!  *Did I know that?*
- What is the function of methyl in insects?
- **Note:** look up CpG_o/e
- in Apis and Pea Aphid:
	- uniform expression between conditions = high methylation 
	- differential expression bt condition = low methylation
	- says its a strong repeating pattern
- fire ant diploid vs haploid males:
	- increased gene expression tends to track with increased DNAmeth
	- as variation in gene expression increases DNAmeth decreases
	- most DNAmeth seen in Haploid males... (not sure I got that right)
- Conservation of methylation and other epigenetic data (honey bee vs fire ant and Dmel [no DNAmeth but yes histone modification])
	- over all: within ants, correlatiuon of genes with DNAmeth are very high (r ~>0.7)
	- same in bees
	- between ants/bees: still relatively high correlation (r ~ 0.6)
	- are DNAmeth in genes in ants/bees correleated with specific histone mods in Dmel: 
		- Answer is YES
		- no time to document which hist mods he showed
- Summary:
	- phenoype specific genes are unmethylated
	- ubiquitously genes are methylated
	- DNAmeth associated with ploidy
	- Patterns of DNAmeth conserved within and bewtween species
	- DNAmeth tends to be associated with specific histone mods
	- DNAmeth tied to alternative splicing

********************
Parent of origin effects in gene expression in honey bees

- hybrids between african and european bees sting intermediate of the parents (but if the father is African hybrids are more similar to african bees?)  **NOT SURE I GOT THAT RIGHT**
- Used multiple different mapping methods but didnt say how -- *DONT LIKE THAT*
- Truethfully I dunno if I can talk about the rest because I can't tell if his biases are real or due to not using the same mapper in all conditions...
